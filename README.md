# 3D Image Slider / Bay Window Animation

A visually captivating image slider designed with a unique "bay window" or carousel effect, showcasing advanced CSS 3D transforms and dynamic control via JavaScript.

## Key Features

* **Sophisticated 3D Transforms:** Leverages CSS properties like `transform-style: preserve-3d`, `perspective`, `rotateY`, and `translateZ` to build a genuine 3D visual space.
* **Dynamic Positioning:** Uses CSS custom properties (`--position`) in conjunction with JavaScript to precisely control the placement and rotation of each image in the 3D space.
* **Smooth Transitions:** Implements CSS `transition` properties for fluid and high-performance animations.
* **Interactive Design:** Demonstrates how JavaScript can orchestrate complex visual sequences and user interactions.


* HTML5
* CSS3 (Advanced 3D Transforms, Custom Properties, Transitions)
* Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, Event Listeners for control logic)
